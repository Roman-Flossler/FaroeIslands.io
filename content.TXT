<h2>Torshawn – capital town</h2>

<h3>How to get there</h3>
Torshavn is located on another island than airport. There is a submarine tunel (this one is paid),
 so you can rent a car or take a bus to get to Torshavn from the airport. 
 If you travel to the Faroe Islands by ferry from Denmark, you will land directly in Torshavn.

<h3>What to see</h3>

Tinganes is Torshavn's old town, it was built in 16th century and people still live there.
Tinganes means  "parliament jetty" or "parliament point" and the parliament met there for the first time in the Viking ages (one of the oldest in the world). 
Tinganes is still used 


<h2>Traveling through Tunnels</h2>
There are lot of tunnels on Fareoe Islands, but toll is only paid when you drive through one of submarine tunnels. 
One way through tunnel costs 100 DKK and it should be paid at gas station within 48 hours. If you drive rented car, 
you don't have to worry about it, rental company takes care about toll payment.


All three submarine tunnels are marked on the map, the newest one has even a roundabout under the sea.

Because the mountain on the Faroe Islands are quite high, it isn't unusual, that there is a different weather on the other side of the tunnel.
It is always good idea to check webcams, to see real weather in place, before you go there.

<h2>Traveling by bus and ferries</h2>
Buses and ferries operates Strandfaraskip Landsins (SSL), which is nationally owned and provides transport to all corners of the Faroe Islands.
Travel map, ticket prices, rules and all other information are on SSL website - www.ssl.fo

There may be not enough space in public transport for larger groups, so if you wish to use bus or ferry in group of more than 10 people,
you need to book transport in advance - https://www.ssl.fo/en/booking/

Ferry to Mykines island has to booked even if you are a sole traveler. You can do it on website https://www.mykines.fo/. It is good idea to do it as soon as possible,
because Mykines is very popular destination due to Papuchalks and hike to lighthouse.
